=head1 NAME

mocked - use mocked libraries in unit tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # use a fake LWP::Simple for testing from t/lib/LWP/Simple.pm
  use mocked 'LWP::Simple';
  my $text = get($url);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Often during unit testing, you may find the need to use mocked libraries
to test edge cases, or prevent unit tests from using slow or external
code.

This is where mocking libraries can help.

When you mock a library, you are creating a fake one that will be used
in place of the real one.  The code can do as much or as little as is
needed.

Use mocked.pm as a safety measure (be sure you're actually using the
mocked module), and as a way to document the tests for future
maintainers.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 import

This function will make sure the module you specify is loaded from t/lib.

=cut

sub import {
    my $class = shift;
    my $module = shift;

    my $mock_path = 't/lib';
    my @old_inc = @INC;
    @INC = ($mock_path);
    eval "require $module";
    @INC = @old_inc;
    die if $@;

    my $import = $module->can('import');
    @_ = ($module, @_);
    goto &$import if $import;
}
